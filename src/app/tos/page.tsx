          <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
          <p>Effective date: 17/03/2024</p>

          <section>
            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>By using Clack you confirm your acceptance of, and agree to be bound by, these terms and conditions.</p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2>2. Agreement to Terms and Conditions</h2>
            <p>This Agreement takes effect on the date on which you first use the Clack application.</p>

            <h2>3. Software License and Payments</h2>
            <p>
              The Clack Software License facilitates the use of Clack software through monthly, yearly, or one-time
              payments. It grants users unrestricted and perpetual access to comprehensive writing analytics features as
              long as payments are continued according to the chosen plan.
            </p>

            <p>
              For monthly and yearly payment plans, recurring subscription fees will apply. One-time purchases grant
              access without needing to pay recurring fees. However, for all payment plans, the licensor retains the
              right to terminate the license at their discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              This license arrangement exempts one-time purchase users from subscriptions while enabling Clack to
              exercise control over software distribution and utilization. Opting for any payment plan enables you to
              enjoy the software benefits while recognizing Clackâ€™s unrestricted termination rights, providing
              adaptability and addressing unforeseen circumstances.
